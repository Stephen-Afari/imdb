This is a movie database website that combines the power of NextJS and Tailwind CSS. It has a sleek and intuitive design with a powerful search bar that enables you to search for any movie of your choice. Daily movie updates are provided by the trending and top rated sections. It seemlessly integrates Server side and client side components. You can switch between Dark and Light mode.
